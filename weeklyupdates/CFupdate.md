Had to refer her to a web app get the values she wanted. (she was not interested in using R and I didn’t have the expertise to gin it up with SPSS syntax). 
    * Nursing PhD student; tried debugging her R code but without success. She was a walk in. Using a package to interface to a 3rd party software program to download and process environmental data. The problem seems to be with the type of data she’s using. It appears to be different from what is used in the package examples. We’ll probably meet again.
    * Research Fellow, Allergy & Immunology. Help creating a split-violin plot for a paper in response to reviewer’s request. Used the beanplot package.
    * Psych faculty; this has turned into a weekly session where I answer random R questions usually involving graphics. Teaches stats in the Psych department and is a long time SPSS user.

    * Curry PhD student; help resolving errors and warnings with mixed-effect models in SPSS. For her dissertation. 
    * Curry faculty; More work on her recent nutrition study. Data wrangling, descriptive stats and some inference.

    * Started work on a StatLab blog post that explains how to assess Type S (sign) and Type M (magnitude) errors as outlined in Gelman and Carlin’s 2014 paper. I think it’s an interesting supplement to traditional power analysis. The paper is accessible, but I wanted to write a blog post that fills in gaps in the paper where the authors assume certain statistical concepts. 


## 2018-10-24

* Consultations:
    * PhD candidate at Darden. Had concerns about data not being normally distributed for a t-test. Pointed him to a journal article that explicitly addressed his concern. It showed through simulations that the Normality assumption was sufficient but not necessary for the validity of the t-test. https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140546

    * PhD candidate Anthropology; conducted archaeological survey and excavations on a sugar plantation. Needs to analyze the artifact data she collected and wanted some guidance with the statistics. Talked about some different approaches as well as using ggplot to help create some basic visualizations. Sent her an R script to help her plot some means with error bars
    * Psych faculty. Help iron out some issues with creating plots to demonstrate kurtosis. Also help modify an R function for calculating power to have a more descriptive title.
    * Nursing PhD candidate. Questions about identifying and dealing with missing data. This is air quality data. I think she wants to impute missing data from certain stations with available data from nearby stations. I think. I’m still trying to figure out what exactly she wants. We’ve been doing this over email. Sent her some sample R code to help her get started exploring the missingness in her data.

## 2018-10-02
* Consultations: 
    * Politics PhD candidate; Looking for advice getting started with text mining Chinese social media and identifying types of propaganda. Suggested she start with a small collection of text and start working on getting it into R/Python, creating a corpus, creating a TDM, summarizing features of the text, etc to see if she can do what she wants to do. 
    * Biology grad student; asked about non-parametric 2 way anova. I couldn’t find anything other than a Friedman test, which I don’t think is what he needs. Mentioned that the usual parametric ANOVA is fairly robust to departures from normality and may be fine. Provided some simulations that showed non-normal and heteroscedastic data can be virtually indistinguishable from Normal data from a graphical standpoint (and suitable for ANOVA) but still be rejected by shapiro and levene tests. The point being we should use some judgment before dismissing data as non-normal or having non-constant variability based solely on a hypothesis test. Simulation code here: https://gist.github.com/clayford/dee4efbe5dd9103751a3565a94b164f7
    * Psych faculty; needed some programming assistance in R. Wanted to automate an R script so it could be run on various data sets and collect the output and plots.

    * EnviSci faculty; has dataset of atmospheric concentrations of numerous gases taken over time and space. Interested in analyzing the different contributions from different emission sources to the total concentrations. For example 50% of the methane concentration is attributed to oil/gas and 50% to rice cultivation. Very challenging consultation, especially since she doesn’t have any training data where she knows the proportion of contributions. 
    * Curry PhD candidate; seeking advice regarding how to handle missing data for mixed-effect modeling
    * UVa staff; provided some assistance with estimating power of a randomized complete block design for a given number of blocks.

Suggested looking into topic-modeling at first but then realized cluster analysis might be better for what he wanted. Pointed to him some resources to help get him started. 
    * Grad student, Civil Engineering; Research involves using two types of neural networks to forecast groundwater level. Wanted to select better model. Suggested that instead of a t-test of the RMSEs between the two models that he take the difference in the 1000 RMSEs from the two models and analyze the distribution of differences with percentile/BCa intervals.

    * surgery resident; has data on vascular surgeries, wants to investigate whether or not certain medications are helpful post-surgery. Data is in Excel, has imported to Stata, wants help cleaning data in Stata. Data is restricted and requires access to a server. He could not access server or even get on Internet while in Brown. (I’ve noticed this a lot with medical employees.) Referred him to Data@HSL.
